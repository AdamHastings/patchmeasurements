This repository contains the code and assets required to build the experimental setup in my paper [How Much is Performance Worth to Users?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3587135.3592194) (preprint [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hastings/wta.pdf)), including the programs used to slow down users' computers. # Patch Measurements Project
